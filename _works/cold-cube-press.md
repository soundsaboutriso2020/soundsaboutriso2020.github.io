desc: Cynthia Alfonso’s The One Who Weeps is a visual examination of the cycle of grief and confusion. Using bright colors and delicate line work, Alfonso invokes a trance state in her work, allowing text and image to build on one another. The book itself is about a persistent cycle of instability- that each day must be spent reconstructing the past in order to move forward through grief and fear.
